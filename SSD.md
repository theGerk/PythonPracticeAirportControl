This project makes use of a priority queue class, the just happened to be found on my hard drive.

After that a AirPort class was implemented to hold all the data about the airport at any point in time, it contains a queue (the priority queue), and a list of plane objects representing what is in the runway, and a current time. This class also uses a a toString function that gives a string formated for human readablility, that gives: the current time, what plane is on each runway and when they take off, what planes are waiting to get on the runway, and their number in the queue, the time they submitted their request and for whe, also how long they will take when they get on the runway and what time they are predicted to get onto a runway and what runway it will be. There is also most importantly a tick function on this class that increments the time by 1 and does any logic therin required (moving planes on and off the runway, adding them to the queue and removing them from it).
